**# Air-Passengers-Time-Series-Analysis
**This dataset provides monthly totals of a US airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. This dataset is taken from an inbuilt dataset of R called AirPassengers.**
Steps Followed**
1. # Importing Libraries
2. # Import data
3. # Change date format to Date time from sting
4. # Plotting Graph passenger vs time Graph
5. # Determining rolling Statistics
6. # Plot rolling statistics
7. # Perform Dickey Fuller Test to check data Staionarity
8. # Plotting with Log time series
9. # Checking Stationary Data with LOG Data
10. # Check Weighted Average
11. # Shift Data for Time Series
